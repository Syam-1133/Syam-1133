# Hi there, I'm Syam 👋
I build scalable AI systems that go from research → deployment → real-world impact.

## About Me
I'm Syam, an MS student with 5 years of engineering experience and 2 years as machine learning engineer who's big on consistency and hard work. I enjoy messy data, tight deadlines, and AI systems that have to work in the real world. I show up every day to build, learn, break things, and fix them.

I specialize in building end-to-end AI systems — from data pipelines and model training to deployment and optimization.

I enjoy solving real-world problems where models must work outside notebooks and in production environments.
